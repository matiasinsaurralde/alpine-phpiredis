alpine-phpiredis
===

phpiredis is a PHP extension that wraps [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis).

This is a package for Alpine, maybe it will get merged into ```experimental```, I've sent a [patch](http://lists.alpinelinux.org/alpine-devel/5199.html) to the ```alpine-devel``` mailing list.

## Build

```abuild -r```

## Usage

I'm currently using this for a Docker image.
